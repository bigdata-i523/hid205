        Insurance companies today are incurring a loss in billions of
        dollars every year because of frauds happening in filing
        claims, paying premiums, filling applications etc. Detecting
        frauds manually or by other traditional means is an impossible
        task since magnanimous amounts of data is getting generated
        every day and fraudsters change their strategies very
        quickly. For handling such a humongous amount of data,
        performing real time analysis on it, and getting accurate
        outputs; it is imperative that a robust, flexible and scalable
        technology be used which can detect frauds on the fly. Big
        data provides just the platform needed to perform analysis of
        such high complexity.

    abstract: Location is an important metric when it comes to data. Be it the data of a Retailer which wants to analyze the customer behaviour in a given demography, or the Policemen who want to look into a particular crime committed in a given region, or tracking down a criminal's hideout, or a commercial giant wanting to figure out the ideal location for setting up a new plant to maximize their profits, location and geography play an important role. Knowing the geography can help immensely in generating more value in analysis, and in some extreme cases, like that of the census data of a country without the geography, the other data may prove to be meaningless. Since magnanimous amounts of data is getting generated every single second, at a break-neck speed, companies from across different domains, be it Insurance, Retail, Banking, Finance, Health care, Telecommunications, etc are quickly shifting to Big Data technologies from their traditional approaches. Thus it is an essential task to develop systems which empower the traditional Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the Big data technologies to enhance the analysis and generation of insights.

    abstract: Humongous amounts of data gets generated every day in the domain of e-commerce industry. 

              With the increasing competition and ever-changing market trends, it is a challenging task 

              for the store owners to strategize business and marketing activities. If the companies are 

              able to predict customer behavior, they can come up with business designs which can help them

              in making predictions about the customer purchasing patterns and thereby increase their revenue.

              In this project we have aimed to do analysis on the data of an e-commerce non-store online retail

              giant based in UK. The dataset, available in the UC Irvine repository by the name of `Online Retail', 

              consists of the the goods purchased by different customers at a given time. Through this data

              available to us, we have done customer segmentation on the basis of the type and amount of goods

              purchased by a customer. We achieved this by doing a thorough exploration of the data, data 

              pre-processing and then running different Machine Learning Classifiers to classify the customers

              in different categories.
