This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms,
somewhat loosely, to the formatting guidelines for
ACM SIG Proceedings.

\section{Introduction}


\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.  Remember
that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples
of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we
will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the
reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to
articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are
used as examples only.



\appendix

%Appendix A
\section{Headings in Appendices}

The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for the body of
the article are different in the appendices.  In the \textbf{appendix}
environment, the command \textbf{section} is used to indicate the
start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order designation (i.e., the
first is A, the second B, etc.) and a title (if you include one).  So,
if you need hierarchical structure \textit{within} an Appendix, start
with \textbf{subsection} as the highest level. Here is an outline of
the body of this document in Appendix-appropriate form:

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
\subsubsection{Citations}
\subsubsection{Tables}
\subsubsection{Figures}
\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsection{References}

Generated by bibtex from your \texttt{.bib} file.  Run latex, then
bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references) to create the
\texttt{.bbl} file.  Insert that \texttt{.bbl} file into the
\texttt{.tex} source file and comment out the command
\texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.

% This next section command marks the start of
% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy

\section{More Help for the Hardy}

Of course, reading the source code is always useful.  The file
\path{acmart.pdf} contains both the user guide and the commented code.
